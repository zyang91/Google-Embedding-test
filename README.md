## Population Dynamics Foundation Model (PDFM) Embeddings
PDFM Embeddings are condensed vector representations designed to encapsulate the complex, multidimensional interactions among human behaviors, environmental factors, and local contexts at specific locations. These embeddings capture patterns in aggregated data such as search trends, busyness trends, and environmental conditions (maps, air quality, temperature), providing a rich, location-specific snapshot of how populations engage with their surroundings. Aggregated over space and time, these embeddings ensure privacy while enabling nuanced spatial analysis and prediction for applications ranging from public health to socioeconomic modeling.

## Application

PDFM Embeddings can be applied to a wide range of geospatial prediction tasks, similar to census and socioeconomic statistics. Example use cases include:

- Population Health Outcomes: Predicting health statistics like disease prevalence or population health risks.
- Socioeconomic Factors: Modeling economic indicators and living conditions.
- Retail: Identifying promising locations for new stores, market expansion, and demand forecasting.
- Marketing and Sales: Characterizing high-performance regions and identifying similar areas to optimize marketing and sales efforts.
  
By incorporating spatial relationships and diverse feature types, these embeddings serve as a powerful tool for geospatial predictions.
