## What is Embeddings?

<br>

<span style="font-size: 1.3em;">
In general terms, embeddings are **numerical representations** of complex information that capture the **most important features or relationships** in a simplified, machine-readable form.
</span>

## Blackbox Nature of Embeddings

- The Embeddings generally generated through various neural network models (GNN or CNN) that trained on a large datasets.
- The exact architecture and training process can vary widely depending on the specific application and data type.
- The company or research institutions that developed the embeddings may not disclose the full details of their models due to proprietary or privacy reasons.

## Population Dynamics Foundation (PDFM) Embeddings
::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
- Developed by Google Research (Google Deep Mind) in 2024.
- Input:
  - Census data
  - Searching Trends
  - Other geospatial data
- Output:
  - Multi-dimensional vectors (represent population characteristics and dynamics).
